# ML_Journey
Objective: Repo to capture ML links and learning in a mindmap using markdown.

## Problem Formulation


## Sagemaker
Section to provide sagemaker links.

### Training

- [Sagemaker Training Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-training-toolkit)

Your own docker container



### Evaluation

- [TensorBoard in SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-tensorboard.html)

### Deployment

- [SageMaker Inference Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-inference-toolkit)

Implements model server stack and can be added to any Docker container, making it deployable to SageMaker. See example [Amazon SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoints using your own algorithm container](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/main/advanced_functionality/multi_model_bring_your_own/multi_model_endpoint_bring_your_own.ipynb) using pre-trained ResNet 18 and ResNet 152 models, both trained on the ImageNet datset.

### Serving

### Monitoring

### Maintenance

### Others

#### Development

- [SageMaker SSH Help](https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-ssh-helper)

Allows you to connect your IDE, such as VSCode, to Amazon SageMaker's training jobs, processing jobs, realtime inference endpoints, and SageMaker Studio notebook containers for fast interactive experimentation, remote debugging, and advanced troubleshooting.
